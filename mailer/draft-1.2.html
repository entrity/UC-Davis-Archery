<p>Dear (Organization Name),</p>

<h2>Want an archery experience? Book one at your convenience.</h2>

<p>The UC Davis archery club is offering an archery lesson as a fundraiser. Would you please consider discussing this opportunity with your group's members or organizers?</p>

<p>The 1 hour and 30 minute experience consists of a lesson and coaching provided by multiple instructors, followed by practice. We accept bookings on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-11:30 and 11:30-1. If you require an alternative time, please contact us, and we will see what we can do.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

<h2>Group size</h2>

<p>If your organization cannot assemble more than a few participants, don’t worry. Let us know how many people are interested, and we will endeavor to combine your party with another organization’s.</p>

<p>We require at least 10 people (whether from a single organization or from a combination of multiple organizations) in order to book an archery lesson. We recommend between 15 and 35 participants per session, but we can take as many as 70 at once.</p>

<p>Be advised that when in excess of 35 participants, we must split the group into two shooting lines, with two participants sharing a bow and quiver of arrows.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>If you are a student (of any accredited school) or an affiliate of UC Davis (whether student, faculty, or staff), we will discount your fee by 40%.</p>

<p>Our standard fee is $25 per person ($15 at the aforesaid discount).</p>

<p>To book a lesson, we require a deposit to cover the cost of 10 archers: $150&ndash;$250. (If your organization is combined with another, your deposit will be less than the amounts stated here.) The deposit defrays all or part of your total cost. (I.e. if you have more than 10 archers arrive,  then you have already paid for 10 of them.)</p>

<h2>Additional details</h2>

<p>UC Davis Sports Club and Risk Management policies require that fundraising events be scheduled at least two weeks in advance.</p>

<p>If your organization wishes to bring members under the age of 18, please mention this to us. We have additional regulations governing such events, and we wish to make recommendations to you on how to organize the event.</p>

<p>Please respond to this email or contact us at
<a href="mailto:UCDaggiearchery@gmail.com">UCDaggiearchery@gmail.com</a> to book today.</p>
